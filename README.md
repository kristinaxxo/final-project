# Final Project Proposal

## Project Description

1. What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be?

    The dataset we will be working with is **Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016**. [Rusty](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88) collected this dataset. It was accessed through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016), which is an open online datasets platform.The person who created this dataset used references from [United Nations Development Program](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506), [World Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/world-development-indicators#), [Suicide in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/suicide-in-the-twenty-first-century/notebook) and [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/en/). The collection of data has the intention to prevent future suicide.

2. Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.

  The ultimate purpose of analyzing this dataset is to prevent future suicide. Hence, our main target audience would be any non-profit organizations that have the goal of reducing suicide rates, mentors at school and therapies who specilise on this subject.

3. What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

 - Question 1: How does the change in GDP per capita affect the suicide rates? Do developed countries and developing countries tend to have the same relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rates.

 - Question 2:

 - Question 3:

## Technical Description
 - How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

 - What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

 - What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

 - What major challenges do you anticipate?

 - Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
